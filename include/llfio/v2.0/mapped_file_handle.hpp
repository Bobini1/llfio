All the major OSs on all the major 64 bit CPU architectures now offer at least 127 Tb of address
spaces to user mode processes. This makes feasible mapping multi-Tb files directly into
memory, and thus avoiding the syscall overhead involved when reading and writing. This
becames **especially** important with next-gen storage devices capable of Direct Access
Storage (DAX) like Optane from 2018 onwards, performance via syscalls will always be
but a fraction of speaking directly to the storage device via directly mapped memory.

As an example of the gains, on Microsoft Windows to read or write 1Kb using the standard
syscalls takes about fifteen times longer than the exact same i/o via mapped memory. On Linux,
OS X or FreeBSD the gain is considerably lower, a 1Kb i/o might only be 50% slower via syscalls
than memory maps. However for lots of say 64 byte i/o, the gain of memory maps over
syscalls is unsurpassable.

This class combines a `file_handle` with a `section_handle` and a `map_handle` to
implement a fully memory mapped `file_handle`. The whole file is always mapped entirely
into memory, and `read()` and `write()` i/o is performed directly with the map.
Reads always return the original mapped data, and do not fill any buffers passed in.
For obvious reasons the utility of this class on 32-bit systems is limited,
but can be useful when used with smaller files.

Note that zero length files cannot be memory mapped, and writes past the maximum
extent do NOT auto-extend the size of the file, rather the data written beyond the maximum valid
extent has undefined kernel-specific behaviour, which includes segfaulting. You must therefore always
`truncate(newsize)` to resize the file and its maps before you can read or write to it,
and be VERY careful to not read or write beyond the maximum extent of the file.

Therefore, when a file is created or is otherwise of zero length, `address()` will return
a null pointer. Similarly, calling `truncate(0)` will close the map and section handles,
they will be recreated on next truncation to a non-zero size.

For better performance when handling files which are growing, there is a concept of
"address space reservation" via `reserve()` and `capacity()`, which on some kernels
is automatically and efficiently expanded into when the underlying file grows.
The implementation asks the
kernel to set out a contiguous region of pages matching that reservation, and to map the
file into the beginning of the reservation. The remainder of the pages may be inaccessible
and may generate a segfault, or they may automatically reflect any growth in the underlying
file. This is why `read()` and `write()` only know about the reservation size, and will read
and write memory up to that reservation size, without checking if the memory involved exists
or not yet. You are guaranteed on POSIX only that `address()` will not return a new
value unless you truncate from a bigger length to a smaller length, or you call `reserve()`
with a new reservation or `truncate()` with a value bigger than the reservation.

`maximum_extent()` in mapped file handle is an alias for `update_map()`. `update_map()`
fetches the maximum extent of the underlying file, and if it has changed from the map's
length, the map is updated to match the underlying file, up to the reservation limit.
You can of course explicitly call `update_map()` whenever you need the map to reflect
changes to the maximum extent of the underlying file.

It is up to you to detect that the reservation has been exhausted, and to
reserve a new reservation which will change the value returned by `address()`. This
entirely manual system is a bit tedious and cumbersome to use, but as mapping files
is an expensive operation given TLB shootdown, we leave it up to the end user to decide
when to expend the cost of mapping.

\warning You must be cautious when the file is being extended by third parties which are
not using this `mapped_file_handle` to write the new data. With unified page cache kernels,
mixing mapped and normal i/o is generally safe except at the end of a file where race
conditions and outright kernel bugs tend to abound. To avoid these, solely and exclusively
use a dedicated handle configured to atomic append only to do the appends.

## Microsoft Windows only

Microsoft Windows can have quite different semantics to POSIX, which are important to be
aware of.

On Windows, the length of any section object for a file can never exceed the maximum
extent of the file. Open section objects therefore clamp the valid maximum extent of
a file to no lower than the largest of the section objects open upon the file. This
is enforced by Windows, which will return an error if you try to truncate a file to
smaller than any of its section objects on the system.

Windows only implements address space reservation for sections opened with write
permissions. LLFIO names the section object backing every mapped file uniquely to
the file's inode, and all those section objects are shared between all LLFIO processes
for the current Windows session. This means that if any one process updates a section
object's length, the section's length gets updated for all processes, and all maps
of that section in all processes get automatically updated.

This works great if, and only if, the very first mapping of any file is with a writable
file handle, as that permits the global section object to be writable, and all other
LLFIO processes then discover that writable global section object. If however the
very first mapping of any file is with a read-only file handle, that creates a
read-only section object, and that in turn **disables all address space reservation
permanently for all processes** using that file.

So long as you ensure that any shared mapped file is always opened first with writable
privileges, which is usually the case, all works like POSIX on Microsoft Windows.

  /*! \brief Write data to the mapped file.

  If this mapped file handle was constructed with `section_handle::flag::write_via_syscall`, this function is
  actually implemented using the equivalent to the kernel's `write()` syscall. This will be very significantly
  slower for small writes than writing into the map directly, and will corrupt file content on kernels without
  a unified kernel page cache, so it should not be normally enabled. However, this technique is known to work
  around various kernel bugs, quirks and race conditions found in modern OS kernels when memory mapped i/o
  is performed at scale (files of many tens of Gb each).

  \note This call traps signals and structured exception throws using `QUICKCPPLIB_NAMESPACE::signal_guard`.
  Instantiating a `QUICKCPPLIB_NAMESPACE::signal_guard_install` somewhere much higher up in the call stack
  will improve performance enormously. The signal guard may cost less than 100 CPU cycles depending on how
  you configure it. If you don't want the guard, you can write memory directly using `address()`.

  \return The buffers written, which will never be the buffers input because they will point at where the data was copied into the mapped view.
  The size of each scatter-gather buffer is updated with the number of bytes of that buffer transferred.
  \param reqs A scatter-gather and offset request.
  \param d Ignored.
  \errors If during the attempt to write the buffers to the map a `SIGBUS` or `EXCEPTION_IN_PAGE_ERROR` is raised,
  an error code comparing equal to `errc::no_space_on_device` will be returned. This may not always be the cause
  of the raised signal, but it is by far the most likely.
  \mallocs None if a `QUICKCPPLIB_NAMESPACE::signal_guard_install` is already instanced.
